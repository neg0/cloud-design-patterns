# Cloud Design Patterns (Availability and Resilience)
There are over 40 Design Patterns for Cloud Architecture and distributed systems deployed on Cloud 
Based Solutions. Here I provide an example of patterns in SRE principles where we need to provide 
an efficient availability and resilience for edge cases and spikes.

In this repository I will explain enterprise level design patterns used for distributed systems to 
provide higher availability and work with hardware resources more efficiently.

## List of Patterns
* [Circuit Breaker Pattern](https://github.com/neg0/cloud-design-patterns/tree/master/src/CircuitBreaker)
* [Compensating Transaction Pattern](https://github.com/neg0/cloud-design-patterns/tree/master/src/CompensatingTransaction)
* [Health Endpoint Monitoring Pattern](https://github.com/neg0/cloud-design-patterns/tree/master/src/HealthEndpointMonitoring)
* Queue-based Load Leveling Pattern
* Retry Pattern
* Throttling Pattern
